Currently, this project mainly focuses on _**GB (England, Scotland & Wales)**_ users. 
While it _**will**_ work for users outside of this region, some features _(such as weather alerts)_ are limited to only the areas listed above.

### Todo (in order of importance)
- [ ] Improve error logging. Make errors be returned to users in a simplistic manner.
- [ ] Add RSS feed integrations
- [ ] Weather maps (https://openweathermap.org/api/weathermaps)
- [ ] Cache BBC News, Openweathermap results and RSS Feeds (ask)
