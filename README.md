# Newsflash API

---
_Last updated: 2025/10/06_

Newsflash is a custom-built project for myself, its purpose is to act as a smart mirror.

A few features are region specific, as it is purpose built just for me and my location, however anybody else is free to take the
code, modify it, and redistribute it provided they follow and retain the MIT License attached.
Including adding more features or editing anything they want. Pull requests are accepted however I can't know for sure
if I'll still be working on this in the future.

Currently, this project mainly focuses on users in the _**United Kingdom**_. 
While it *will* work for users outside the _**UK**_, some features _(such as weather alerts and transport)_ are limited to 
only the _**UK**_ and/or _**London**_.

Pull requests to improve functionalities are welcomed!

If you would like to use or deploy this yourself, you are also welcome, but please be aware technical difficulties may arise often. At the time of writing it has not been fully or even mostly tested.
